Filling out the Canadian government's [informal Access to Information and Privacy requests (ATIP) form](https://open.canada.ca/en/search/ati) can be a bore, especially if you need to do several at a time. This bookmarklet makes the process easier by pre-filling out all the fields so that you can just hit "Submit."

To install the bookrmarklet, go to the URL below, fill out the form, then drag the button into your bookmarks bar and youâ€™re good to go. Will only work in latest versions of desktop Chrome and Firefox.
